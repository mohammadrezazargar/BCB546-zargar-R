## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Overall, the code was running smooth without any errors. Great Job! 
#I liked your own visualisation of having SNP transistions..the plots were really good! 

#I have a few minor comments about the errors that I have got

#The file path error was solved after you haved reviewed and committed changes. Thankyou so much for that

#2.Load all packages needed in the Markdown file as it gave me a few errors
#NA introduction warnings were there multiple times. I believe there is something wrong about numeric position function may be you can use conditional statement to convert only numeric values or remove them before converting but didn't impact any results.
